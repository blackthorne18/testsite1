## PhD studying Plasmid-Host Dynamics in the context of Antibiotic Resistance with Dr. James Hall
- Studying persistence of antimicrobial resistance as a function of plasmid persistence in the host
- Understanding the interaction dynamics of the plasmid and the host genome

## Research Project on evolution of antibiotic resistance with Dr. Samay Pande
- Understanding the influence of multiple selection-constrains on the de-novo evolution of antibiotic resistance
- Studying evolution of antibiotic resistance in prey bacteria in the presence of a predator and evolution of escape strategies by the prey. The model system used was of M xanthus (predator) and E coli, P fluorescence and S enterica (prey).
- Experimental coevolution of M xanthus and three prey bacteria - Microbial culture techniques
- Analysis of predatory efficiency of and competition between clones of M xanthus from a population mixing evolution experiment
- Standardisation of NGS based Frequency Analysis of M xanthus and E coli clones

## Research Project on REPIN Movemenet and Dynamics with Dr. Frederic Bertels
- Understanding movement patterns and duplication rate of REPIN Transposable Elements in Pseudomonas genome sequences
- Creating and testing of REPIN Clusterer - a Bioinformatics pipelines in Python Programming Language 
- Developed innovative computational method of clustering REPIN Sequences together based on orthology 
- Established events of duplication of REPIN Sequences based on the Clusters and calculated their rate of duplication. 
- Critical analysis of potential theories on movement of REPIN within host genome 
- Automated BLAST searches, isolated genes, compared genes, built, compared and analysed phylogenetic trees, curated computer code and datasets

## iGEM 2020 Project: Beta-cells in Gut Producing Insulin (BIG-PIE)
- A new method of providing insulin to patients with diabetes
- Helped Brainstorm project ideas during the nascent stage
- Helped with building the Project Website
- Contributed to Outreach and Science Communication by conducting seminars for School students
- Gold Medal Winning Project at The Giant Jamboree, iGEM 2020

## Research Project in Behavioral Ecology with Prof. Renee Borges
- Understanding the natural history and behaviour of the Pentatomid bug onFicus racemosa
- Standardising a new system to work with as the Pentatomid bug is very poorly characterised
- Trying to understand the relation between the Pentatomid bug and it's temporary, dependent hostFicus racemosa
- Designing experiments to study phoresy in the Nematode-Fig Wasp system

## iGEM 2019 Project: Ecoli Learns Suboptimal Acclimatisation (ELSA)
- Synthetically modifying Ecoli to grow optimally at 4 degrees Celsius
- Helped manage the Wet Lab experiments by performing Growth Curve experiments to analyse the effect of our Gene of Interest
- Helped the Outreach and Integrated Human Practices team by talking to people in the industry regarding our product.
- Silver Medal Winning Project at The Giant Jamboree, iGEM 2019
